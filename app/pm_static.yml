# Frostbee - Static Flash Partition Layout
#
# nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) with UF2 bootloader
#
# Protects the bootloader region at the top of flash from being
# overwritten by ZBOSS NVRAM operations.  Without this file the
# partition manager may place ZBOSS storage in the bootloader area,
# bricking the device.
#
# The reserved bootloader region (128 KB) is deliberately oversized
# to be safe regardless of which bootloader variant is installed
# (Nordic Open Bootloader, Adafruit UF2, etc.).  After recovery,
# check the actual bootloader start address:
#
#   nrfjprog --memrd 0x10001014   (reads UICR.BOOTLOADERADDR)
#
# Then you can shrink the reserved region and reclaim flash for the app.
