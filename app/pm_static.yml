# Frostbee - Development Flash Partition Layout
#
# nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) with UF2 bootloader
#
# NO ZBOSS NVRAM partitions — the Zigbee stack cannot write to flash,
# so it cannot corrupt the bootloader.  The device will rejoin the
# network on every boot, which is fine for development.
#
# For production builds with persistent Zigbee storage, use:
#   -DPM_STATIC_YML_FILE=pm_static_release.yml
